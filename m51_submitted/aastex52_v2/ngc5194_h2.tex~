\begin{abstract}

We present Spitzer Space Telescope IRS Low Resolution maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) rotational lines from a radial strip across NGC 5194 (M51a).  We have detected warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ to the outer spiral arms in \objectname{NGC 5194}.  From the maps, the $\mathrm{H_2}$ temperature, mass, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) are mapped across NC 5194.  Maps reveal that the coolest molecular hydrogen in found in the spiral arms and that the OPR varies from the equilibrium value of 3 in the nucleus to 2 - 2.5 in the spiral arms and even lower in the warm inter-arm regions.  The warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ is compared to the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ as traced by CO (J=1-0) emission.  We compare emission regions and the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass to the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass.

\section{Introduction}

The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51, NGC 5194) is a nearby, face-on galaxy that has been extensively studied in x-rays (Palumbo et al. 1985,  Terashima et al. 2001); UV, optical (Scoville et al. 2001), and IR (Calzetti et al. 2005); submillimeter (Matsushita et a. 2004); millimeter (Helfer and Blitz 1997); and radio wavelengths (Murphy et al. 2005).   At a distance of 9.6 Mpc (Sandage and Tammann, 1975), its proximity, orientation, and morphology make it an ideal target to study the interstellar medium (ISM) across dynamically distinct environments in a galaxy.  Thus, it has been called a $Rosetta$ $Stone$ for galaxy evolution (Scoville and Young, 1983).  NGC 5194 hosts a weak Seyfert II nucleus that hosts a bipolar outflow source that has been observed at radio continuum and x-ray wavelengths.  Optical HST imagery has revealed large OB associations across NGC 5194 within the optical spiral arms and inter-arm regions(Scoville et al. 2001).  CO observations reveal vast amounts of molecular gas within the spiral arms of NGC 5194 and that the peaks in CO emission coincide with the optical dust lanes (Vogel et al. 1988).   

The primary constituent of the molecular gas in the ISM is molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H_2}$).  In the ISM, stars form from the collapse of Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) that are composed of primarily $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Thus, $\mathrm{H_2}$ is the fuel for star formation.  Observations of the  $\mathrm{H_2}$ pure rotational lines in the infrared wavelengths covered by Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) IRS low resolution modules (5 - 38 \micron) provide powerful diagnostics of the conditions of the $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Observations of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines allow for the determination of the temperature, mass, and ortho-to-para (OPR) of the warm (T~150-1200 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ and in turn we can discern the excitation mechanism of the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Kaufman et al. (2006) showed that the OPR varies across a PDR due to variations in $\mathrm{H_2}$ temperature.  Neufeld et al. (1998) observed warm, shock heated $\mathrm{H_2}$ in molecular outflow source HH54 at a temperature of 650 K and with a non-equilibrim OPR of 1.2.  
 
Previous studies of $\mathrm{H_2}$ in NGC 5194 have used CO observations to infer the mass of the cold (T~5-75 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Such studies invoke a conversion factor to convert from the CO luminosity to the $\mathrm{H_2}$ number density.  The $Spitzer$ $Infrared$ $Nearby$ $Galaxies$ $Survey$ (\objectname{SINGS}) has surveyed the $\mathrm{H_2}$ content of a sample of nearby galaxies.  They find that within a 330 $\mathrm{arcsec^2}$ region around the nucleus of NGC 5194, $\mathrm{H_2}$ exists in both a warm (T = 180 K) phase and a hotter (T = 521 K) phase, with an ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of 3, and at a number density of 1.75 x 10^{-24} $\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ (Roussel et al., in prep.).

In this paper, we present spatially resolved observations of the rotational lines of $\mathrm{H_2}$ across a radial strip of NGC 5194.  Using the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) (Houck et al. 2004) on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have spectrally mapped a radial strip (295 x 51 $\mathrm{arcsec^2}$ in the long low module and 324 x 57 $\mathrm{arcsec^2}$ in the short low module) across \object{NGC 5194} in order to probe the conditions of the warm (T = 150-1200 K) molecular ISM across dynamically distinct environments.  IRS low resolution spectra cover 5 - 38 \micron  which allows for the observation of the lowest rotational energy levels of molecular hydrogen from S(0) to S(7).  From the spatially resolved IRS low resolution spectra, maps of emission from the six lowest pure rotational transitions of $\mathrm{H_2}$, the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines, have been created with PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2006).  These maps represent measurements of extinction corrected line flux across \objectname{NGC 5194} (further discussed in \S2).  Maps are used to calculate the temperature, mass, and OPR in \objectname{NGC 5194} as a function of region (\S3).  Additionally, the warm molecular hydrogen distribution is compared to the cold molecular hydrogen distribution as traced by CO emission (\S4).   

\section{Observations, Data Reduction, and Analysis}

\subsection{Spectral Data}

Spectra were obtained for \objectname{NGC 5194} using the two low-resolution modules of the Infrared Spectrograph (Houck et al. 2004) in spectral mapping mode. In spectral mapping mode, we moved the IRS in a series of discrete steps settling at each position before beginning integration.  Half slit spacing were used for all integrations. Integration times in the SL and LL were 14.6 s.  Each slit position was covered twice.  In total, 1,412 spectra were taken in the SL while 100 were taken in the LL (including background observations).  SL integrations were taken perpendicular to the LL integrations in accordance with the SINGS radial strip mapping strategy specified in by Kennicutt et al (2003).  Further details on the observations strategy are available on SST's Leopard for project ID 200138 (PI: K. Sheth).  Dedicated off source background observations were taken for the SL observations.  Backgrounds for the LL observations were taken from outrigger data collected while the spacecraft was mapping in the adjacent module. 

The spectra were assembled from the basic calibration data into spectral cubes for each module using CUBISM (Smith et al. 2006, in preparation).  CUBISM allows for the assembly of cubes, extraction of spectra, and creation of spectral maps.  Background subtraction and bad pixel removal was done within CUBISM.  The individual IRS spectra were processed using version S14.0 of the Spitzer Science Center pipeline.

Spectral maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines were created with PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2006), a robust mid-infrared spectral fitting routine.  PAHFIT decomposes an IRS low resolution spectrum allowing the recovery of the full flux of blended features.  This allows the recovery of the full line flux of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ features, including severely blended lines such as $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1), blended with the 17 \micron  PAH complex (Smith et al. 2004); $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), blended with [NeII](12.8 \micron); and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5), blended into [ArII](6.9 \micron). 

In order to run PAHFIT though the SL and LL data cubes, the SL1 data cube was interpolated to the SL2 data cube.  The data cubes were then concatenated into one SL cube.  The same procedure was used to concatenate the LL1 and LL2 data cubes into one LL data cube.  In regions where the first order (SL1, LL1) spectra overlapped with the second order (SL2, LL2) spectra, the first order spectra were scaled up to the second order spectra.  The concatenated data cubes were then smoothed spatially by a 3x3 box to increase the signal to noise ratio of spectra.  Grouping spectra was also done to avoid pixel aliasing, which has the affect of creating a saw-tooth pattern in the continuum (CUBISM User Manual).  PAHFIT was then run through both the SL and LL data cubes.  The SL data cube was fit separately from the LL data cube.

PAHFIT decomposes every spectrum in both the SL and LL data cubes.  In doing so, PAHFIT returns fit parameters to the specified features in the spectrum.  These parameters include integrated line flux, line FWHM, line equivalent width, and uncertainty.  While running PAHFIT through the data cubes, information concerning the position of each spectrum was retained.  This allows for the reconstruction of spectral feature (PAH, $\mathrm{H_2}$, ionization line) maps from the results of PAHFIT.  When using PAHFIT on an entire data cube, maps of every feature specified by PAHFIT were returned.  Additionally, the fit to each spectrum was retained and the fit to the continuum was reconstructed from internal PAHFIT functions.  From these two data cubes, a residual data cube and a continuum subtracted data cube were created for both the SL and LL data cubes.  These data cubes are crucial in determining the consistency of the fitted spectra.  In order to check the accuracy of the map of $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) integrated flux, it was compared it to the image created from the continuum subtraction to the SL data cube. 

In using PAHFIT, the default values for the temperatures of the starlight and eight thermal dust continuum components were used to fit the continuum.  Additionally, the optical depth of the dust extinction at 9.7 \micron  and 18 \micron  were also fit.  This was especially important in recovering an accurate measurement of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) 9.6 \micron  line in the 9.7 \micron  silicate absorption trough.

\subsection{CO Map}

The BIMA (Berkely Illinois Maryland Array) CO (J=1-0) map was acquired as a part of the BIMA Survey of  Nearby Spiral Galaxies (SONG) (Regan et al. 2001; Helfer et al. 2003). The CO map was mosaicked from 26 fields.  The beam size is 5.8 x 5.1 $\mathrm{arcsec^2}$ (220 x 190 $\mathrm{pc^2}$), the velocity channel width is 10 km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and the root-mean-square (rms) noise level is 61 mJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$.   

%\section{$\mathrm{H_2}$ Mapping Method}

%Spectral maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines were created with PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2006), a robust mid-infrared spectral fitting routine.

\section{Results}

\subsection{$\mathrm{H_2}$ Emission Maps}

Molecular Hydrogen emission has been detected across \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines have been mapped across the radial  strip.  In figures 1 and 2, maps of the extinction corrected flux of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) – $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines are presented.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) lines (figure 1) lie in the LL module of the IRS and the resolution of the maps is 5.08 arcsec/pixel.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) – $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines (figure 2) lie in the SL module of the IRS and these maps each have a resolution of 1.85 arcsec/pixel.  This explains the relative smoothness of $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) maps compared to the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) – $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) maps.  The boxes around the maps represent the regions over which the lines were mapped.  

Maps reveal remarkable differences in the morphology of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) emission is strongest in the NW spiral arm with much lower emission coming from the nucleus.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission peaks in towards the nucleus of the galaxy with strong emission in the NW and SE spiral arms.  In the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission, we are able to resolve molecular hydrogen emission in the outer spiral arms at several kiloparsecs from the center of the galaxy.  While we resolve molecular hydrogen emission in the outer spiral arms, the peaks in $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission within the arms do not align.

The higher resolution $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) – $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) maps also show different morphology to \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) map shows the strongest emission in the nuclear region of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  We see similar strong $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission from $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3); however, there appears to be a bar structure across the nucleus of the galaxy going north-to-south.  Again, we see offsets in the peak emission within the spiral arms of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  These offsets are real and indicate variations in the excitation temperature and OPR in each region.

Maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines show a remarkable different morphology to the nuclear region of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) nuclear emission follows the nuclear emission of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) line, while the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) nuclear emission mirrors the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) emission.  This indicates variations in the excitation temperature and OPR.  This will be explored further in the following section (/S4.2).

Due to the sensitivity of the IRS low resolution module, we were unable to resolve $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) emission beyond the central region of \objectname{NGC 5194}.   For the same reason, we were unable to create maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(6) (at 6.11 /micron) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(7) (at 5.51 /micron) lines.  Deeper observations could reveal more complete maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) emission in \objectname{NGC 5194} in addition to allowing us to map the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(6) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(7) lines across \objectname{NGC 5194}.

\subsection{$\mathrm{H_2}$ Temperature, Mass, and OPR}

The pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen provide a powerful probe of the conditions of the ISM.  Knowledge of the extinction corrected flux of the H2S(0) – H2S(5) lines allow for the determination of the temperature, number density (and consequently mass), and OPR by fitting the excitation diagram (Rigopoulou et al. 2002).  Figure 3 shows excitation diagrams from three different areas along the radial strip.  Excitation diagrams are derived from the Boltzman equation
\begin{equation}
N_i/N = (g(i)/Z(\mathrm{T_{ex}}))exp(-T_i/\mathrm{T_{ex}})
\end{equation}
where $g(i)$ is the statistical weight of state $i$, Z($\mathrm{T_{ex}}$) is the partition function, $\mathrm{T_i}$ is the energy level of a given state and $\mathrm{T_{ex}}$ is the excitation temperature.  N and $\mathrm{N_i}$ are the total column density and the column density of a given state $i$ and is determined directly from the measured extinction correct flux by
\begin{equation}
N_i = flux(i)/(A(i)h\nu (i))
\end{equation}
where A(i) and $\nu$(i) are the A-coeficcient and frequency of a state $i$ and $h$ is Planck's constant.  Table 1 lists the values for the wavelength ($\lambda$(i)), rotational state (J), A(i), $\mathrm{T_i}$, and $g(i)$ of the six lowest pure rotational levels of $\mathrm{H_2}$. 

In the nuclear region of NGC 5194, the excitation diagram is smooth and its slope appears to increase at higher rotational levels (Figure 3).  This indicates that there is a range of temperatures being sampled within the beam.  Similar behavior has been observed in extragalactic targets by surveys of Seyferts (Rigopoulou et al. 2002) and ULIRGS (Higdon et al. 2006).  The temperature of the “warm” (T = 100 – 300 K) H2 and the temperature of the “hot” (T = 400 – 1200 K) H2 can be determined from the excitation diagrams by fitting the H2S(0)-H2S(2) lines and the H2S(2) – H2S(5) lines respectively (as opposed to fitting all of the observed H2 rotational lines in order to derive a temperature of the warm H2).  Outside of the central region of NGC 5194, we notice a “zigzag” pattern emerge in the tail of the excitation diagram.  This behavior has been observed before in molecular outflow sources (Neufeld et al. 1999, Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2000, Neufeld et al. 2006).  The “zigzag” indicates a non-LTE OPR in these regions.  The degree of “zigzag” translates into the OPR, with less “zigzag” meaning an OPR closer to the LTE value of 3.  This also suggests that the OPR varies as a function of region across NGC 5194.From a two-component fit to the excitation diagram, we have determined the temperature of the “warm” and “hot” components of H2, the “warm” and “hot” H2 mass, and the OPR across NGC 5194 (figures 4, 5, and 6).  The SL maps were smoothed and interpolated to the spatial resolution of the LL maps and excitation diagrams were created at each point in the maps.  The non-rectangular shape of the temperature, mass, and OPR maps is due to offsets in the alignment of the LL to the SL strip.  In measuring the mass in H2, we first determine the mass from the number density by multiplying the number density by the physical area within the beam (Rigopoulou et al. 2002).  At 9.6 Mpc (Sandage and Tammann 1975), 5.08 arcsec corresponds to 236.43 parsecs.  The maps of the mass distribution are in units of solar masses within a 55.899 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$ region.  The OPR was determined from the fit to the “hot” H2 component.  Figure 4 compares the warm H2 mass to the temperature distribution of the mass.  The gas is warmest in the central region of NGC 5194 with the temperature ranging from 225K – 275 K in the center of the galaxy.  The gas is coolest within the spiral arms of NGC 5194.  The outer NW and SE spiral arms (at about 6-7 kpc from the center of the galaxy each) contain on the order of ___ solar masses and ___ solar masses of H2 (in the NW and SE arms, respectively) and the gas within the outer spiral arms ranges from 150 K at the center of the arms to about 225 K near the edges.  Note that due to zero detection of H2 in some of the inner arm regions, we are unable to determine the temperature distribution across the entire strip.  This is evident towards the NW and SE edges of the radial strip.The temperature and mass distribution of the hot H2 reveals a somewhat different picture.  Figure 6 shows the H2 OPR across NGC 5194.  The OPR within the central regions of NGC 5194 is generally close to the LTE value of 3. Across the galaxy, the OPR is lowest in the inter-arm regions falling to as low as 1.25.  The OPR varies across spiral arms, increasing towards the center of the arms.  In the following section, we explore the physical meaning of the OPR across varying regions of NGC 5194.Due to the weakness of the H2S(4) and H2S(5) features, we were unable to detect these features beyond the spiral arms and consequently can not effectively map the OPR out to the outer spiral arms of NGC 5194.  While the radial strip across NGC 5194 is helpful is understanding the H2 temperature, mass, and OPR across the disk of the galaxy, complete IRS low resolution coverage of NGC 5194 with longer integration time is necessary in order to understand “hot” H2 distribution and the H2 OPR across the whole galaxy.

%We have smoothed the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) maps to the resolution of the S(1) maps and interpolated them to the same grid as the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) maps. The six matched maps are then used to create excitation (Boltzmann) diagrams at each point.  From excitation diagrams, the temperature, number density, and OPR can be effectively mapped across NGC 5194.  The mass is extrapolated from the number density by multiplying the number density by the physical size of the region (Rigopolou et al. 2002).  At a distance of 9.6 Mpc (Sandage and Tammann, 1975), 5.08 arcsec corresponds to 13.5 parsecs.  Thus, the maps of the mass distribution(Figure 4) is in units of \&es within a 182.25 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$ region. 

%Figure 3 shows the excitation diagrams of three 182 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$ regions.  The excitation diagrams reveal that the molecular hydrogen is not thermalized across the whole galaxy.  In fact, we find that the excitation diagrams exhibit a change in slope towards higher rotational levels of $\mathrm{H_2}$ indicating that the molecular gas is composed of multiple components that exhibit varying temperatures.  This has been observed in extragalactic surveys before by Rigopoulou et al. (2002) and Higdon et al. (2006).  We fit the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) levels separately from the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) levels in order to probe the temperature of the warm (150 - 300 K) molecular gas and the hot (400 - 1200 K) molecular gas.  

%Figure 4 shows the $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass compared to the warm and hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ temperature distributions, respectively.  In general, cooler regions appear to have more molecular hydrogen.  We find that the greatest $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass is found in the inner spiral arm just NW of the nucleus.  We also find significant $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass in the outer spiral arms.

%In addition to seeing the change in temperature as a function of rotational level, we see a "zigzag" pattern in the excitation diagrams in the higher rotational levels ($\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5)).  This has been observed in molecular outflow sources (Neufeld et al. 1998, Neufeld et al. 2006, Wright et al. 1996) and indicates that the $OPR$ departs from its high temperature equilibrium value of 3.  In figure 5 we use the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) emission to map the $OPR$ across \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The excitation diagrams shown have been selected from the nulear region (bottom) and the spiral arms (top two).  The shape of the excitations diagram of the nuclear region exhibits an OPR closer to 3 than do the spiral arm regions.  Using the temperature excitation diagrams, the OPR can be mapped across \objectname{NGC 5194}.  

%Figure 5 shows the OPR as a function of position in \objectname{NGC 5194}.  Ortho-to-para ratio was calculated from the  $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2),  $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3),  $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and  $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines.  These lines probe the hot  $\mathrm{H_2}$ and all lie in the SL2 module of the IRS.  We see that in the central region of \objectname{NGC 5194}, the OPR is generally near 3.  In the inner arm regions, where the $\mathrm{H_2}$ is the hottest, the OPR departs from local thermodynamic equilibrium and falls to ~1.5.  Within the spiral arms, the OPR varies between 2 ad 2.5.  Generally, warmer regions have a lower OPR.

\subsection{Physical Meaning of the OPR across NGC 5194}

\section{Comparison of $\mathrm{H_2}$ to CO}

Carbon monoxide (CO) observations are a powerful probe of the conditions of the cold molecular gas in the ISM.  Observations of the CO (J = 1 – 0) allow for the determination of the mass of the cold (T ~ 5 – 100 K) molecular hydrogen (Young and Scoville 1991).   In this section we use a map of the CO (J = 1 – 0) emission of \objectname{NGC 5194} acquired as part of the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies (SONG) to compare the cold hydrogen mass traced by the CO emission to the warm hydrogen mass traced by the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) – $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) line emission.

Figure 6 compares $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission to CO emission for the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) – $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) lines.  In the nuclear region, the peak CO emission is offset from the peak $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission.  In the NW spiral arm (where $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) emission is the strongest), the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) spiral arm appears offset from the CO spiral arm.  We believe that this offset is an instrumental effect and results from the 5.08 arcsec/pixel resolution of map.

The determination of the cold molecular hydrogen mass invokes the use of a conversion factor to convert the CO intensity to the $\mathrm{H_2}$ number density.  Here we adopt the equation for cold molecular gas mass calculated by Sheth et al. (2005)
\begin{equation}
M(H_2) = 1.36*1.1*10^4D^2S_{CO} 
\end{equation}
where D is the distance to \objectname{NGC 5194} in Mpc, $\mathrm{S_{CO}}$ is the intensity in Jy km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and M($\mathrm{H_2}$) is in solar masses.  This is based on the CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor of 2.8 x 10^{20} $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ (Bloemen et al. 1986).

Figure 7 shows the comparison between the mass in warm molecular hydrogen to the mass in cold molecular hydrogen as traced by CO emission.  The greatest amounts of warm and cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ are found in the spiral arms.  In general, the cold gas and warm gas are found in the same regions, though it should be noted that the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ found in the SE spiral arm (where there is no CO emission) is real.

Note: The higher resolution CO map that is in Kartik’s GO-2 proposal shows emission in this region.  Just an FYI.
