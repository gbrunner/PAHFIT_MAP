%We present Spitzer Space Telescope IRS Low Resolution maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) rotational lines from a radial strip across NGC 5194 (M51a).  We have detected warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ to the outer spiral arms in \objectname{NGC 5194}.  From the maps, the $\mathrm{H_2}$ temperature, mass, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) are mapped across NC 5194.  Maps reveal that the coolest molecular hydrogen in found in the spiral arms and that the OPR varies from the equilibrium value of 3 in the nucleus to 2 - 2.5 in the spiral arms and even lower in the warm inter-arm regions.  The warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ is compared to the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ as traced by CO (J=1-0) emission.  We compare emission regions and the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass to the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass.

\section{Introduction}

Galactic evolution is inherently correlated with molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H_2}$) within a galaxy.  In the Milky Way Galaxy, we observe $\mathrm{H_2}$ in dense molecular clouds.  
%The primary constituent of the molecular gas in molecular clouds is $\mathrm{H_2}.  
The collapse of these molecular clouds triggers bursts of star formation.  In other galaxies, we observe molecular gas trigger star formation in spiral arms via the passage of a spiral density wave (Vogel et al. 1983), within nuclear regions of galaxies (Young and Deveraux 1991), and at the ends of bars in barred spiral galaxies (Sheth et al. 2000).  Thus, $\mathrm{H_2}$ serves as the fuel for star formation and is fundamentally connected with galaxy evolution.

The Whirlpool Galaxy (M51a, NGC 5194) is a nearby, face-on galaxy that has been extensively studied in X-rays (Palumbo et al. 1985,  Terashima et al. 2001); UV, optical (Scoville et al. 2001), and IR (Calzetti et al. 2005); submillimeter (Matsushita et a. 2004); millimeter (Helfer and Blitz 1997); and radio wavelengths (Murphy et al. 2005).   At a distance of 9.6 Mpc (Sandage and Tammann, 1975), its proximity, orientation, and morphology make it an ideal target to study the interstellar medium (ISM) across distinct dynamical, chemical, and physical environments in a galaxy.  Studies have revealed variations in CO emission and UV radiation field, metallicity gradients, and temperature across the galaxy.  Thus, it has been called a $Rosetta$ $Stone$ for galaxy evolution (Scoville and Young, 1983).  

%NGC 5194 hosts a weak Seyfert II nucleus that hosts a bipolar outflow source that has been observed at radio continuum and x-ray wavelengths (Ford et al. 1985, Wilson et al. 2001).  Optical HST imagery has revealed large OB associations across NGC 5194 within the optical spiral arms and inter-arm regions(Scoville et al. 2001).  CO observations reveal vast amounts of molecular gas within the spiral arms of NGC 5194 with the peaks in CO emission coinciding with the optical dust lanes (Vogel et al. 1988).   

%The primary constituent of the molecular gas in the ISM is molecular hydrogen ($\mathrm{H_2}$).  In the ISM, stars form from the collapse of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) that are composed of primarily $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Thus, $\mathrm{H_2}$ is the fuel for star formation.  
The Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) (Houck et al. 2004) is a powerful tool for observing the $\mathrm{H_2}$  within galaxies and thus deciphering the evolution of M51a.  The Spitzer IRS low resolution modules cover 5 - 38 $\micron$ (SL, 5 - 14 \micron; LL, 14 - 38 \micron) giving observers access to the lowest pure rotational lines of $\mathrm{H_2}$. These lines trace the warm (T = 100 - 1000K) molecular gas and are important diagnostics of the ISM allowing for the determination of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature, mass, and ortho-to-para ratio of $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Thus, by understanding the pure rotational $\mathrm{H_2}$ line emission from a galaxy, constraints can be placed on the energy injection mechanisms (i.e. radiative heating, shocks, turbulence) that heat the molecular gas phases in the ISM.

%Observations of the  $\mathrm{H_2}$ pure rotational lines in the infrared wavelengths covered by the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) IRS low resolution modules (5 - 38 $\micron$) provide powerful diagnostics of the conditions of the $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Observations of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines allow for the determination of the temperature, mass, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of the warm (T = 150-1200 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ and in turn we can discern the excitation mechanism of the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Kaufman et al. (2006) showed that the OPR varies across a PDR due to variations in $\mathrm{H_2}$ temperature.  Neufeld et al. (1998) observed warm, shock heated $\mathrm{H_2}$ in molecular outflow source HH54 at a temperature of 650 K and with a non-equilibrim OPR of 1.2.  
 
%Previous studies of $\mathrm{H_2}$ in NGC 5194 have used CO observations to infer the mass of the cold (T = 5-75 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Such studies invoke a conversion factor to convert from the CO luminosity to the $\mathrm{H_2}$ column density.  The $Spitzer$ $Infrared$ $Nearby$ $Galaxies$ $Survey$ (\objectname{SINGS}) has surveyed the $\mathrm{H_2}$ content of a sample of nearby galaxies.  They find that within a 330 $\mathrm{arcsec^2}$ region around the nucleus of NGC 5194, $\mathrm{H_2}$ exists in both a warm (T = 180 K, M = 1.46 x ${10^{6}}$ $\mathrm{M_\sun}$) phase and a hotter (T = 521 K, mass not given) phase, with an ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of 3 (Roussel et al., in prep.).

%, and at a number density of 1.75 x ${10^{-24}}$ $\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ 

In this paper, we present spatially resolved observations of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ rotational lines across a radial strip of NGC 5194.  Using the Spitzer IRS, we have spectrally mapped a radial strip (295" x 51" in the long low module and 324" x 57" in the short low module) across \object{NGC 5194} in order to understand the conditions of the warm (T = 100 -1000 K) molecular ISM across dynamically distinct environments.  From the spatially resolved IRS low resolution spectra, maps of emission from the six lowest pure rotational transitions of $\mathrm{H_2}$, the $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(0) (28.22 \micron), $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(1) (17.04 \micron), $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(2) (12.28 \micron), $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(3) (9.66 \micron), $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(4) (8.02 \micron), and $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(5) (6.91 \micron) lines were created.  These maps represent measurements of extinction corrected line flux across \objectname{NGC 5194} (presented in \S3.1).  Maps are used to determine the spatial distribution of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature and mass across the galaxy(\S3.2).  The dominant excitation mechanism of $\mathrm{H_2}$ (photodissociation by UV photons, shocks, and/or x-ray dissociation) is determined in various regions across the galaxy by comparing the $\mathrm{H_2}$ distribution to CO (J = 1 - 0) emission (\S4.2), [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission (\S4.3), and x-ray emission (\S4.4).   

\section{Observations, Data Reduction, and Analysis}

\subsection{Spectral Data}

Spectra were obtained for \objectname{NGC 5194} using the two low-resolution modules of the Infrared Spectrograph in spectral mapping mode. In spectral mapping mode, we moved the IRS in a series of discrete steps settling at each position before beginning integration.  Half slit spacing were used for all integrations. Integration times in the SL and LL were 14.6 s.  Each slit position was covered twice.  In total, 1,412 spectra were taken in the SL while 100 were taken in the LL (including background observations).  SL integrations were taken perpendicular to the LL integrations in accordance with the SINGS radial strip mapping strategy specified in by Kennicutt et al (2003).  Further details on the observation strategy are available on SST's Leopard for project ID 200138 (PI: K. Sheth).  Dedicated off source background observations were taken for the SL observations.  Backgrounds for the LL observations were taken from outrigger data collected while the spacecraft was mapping in the adjacent module. 

The spectra were assembled from the basic calibration data into spectral cubes for each module using CUBISM (Smith et al. 2007, in preparation).  CUBISM allows for the assembly of cubes, extraction of spectra, and creation of spectral maps.  Background subtraction and bad pixel removal was done within CUBISM.  The individual IRS spectra were processed using version S14.0 of the Spitzer Science Center pipeline.

Spectral maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines were created with PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2007), a robust mid-infrared spectral fitting routine.  PAHFIT decomposes an IRS low resolution spectrum allowing the recovery of the full flux of blended features.  This allows the recovery of the full line flux of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ features, including severely blended lines such as $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1), blended with the 17 $\micron$ PAH complex (Smith et al. 2004); $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), blended with [NeII](12.8 $\micron$); and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5), blended into [ArII](6.9 $\micron$). 

In order to run PAHFIT though the SL and LL data cubes, the grid of the SL1 data cube was interpolated to the grid of the SL2 data cube.  The data cubes were then concatenated into one SL cube.  The same procedure was used to concatenate the LL1 and LL2 data cubes into one LL data cube.  In regions where the first order (SL1, LL1) spectra overlapped with the second order (SL2, LL2) spectra, the first order spectra were scaled up to the second order spectra.  The concatenated data cubes were then smoothed spatially by a 3x3 box to increase the signal to noise ratio of spectra.  Grouping spectra was also done to avoid pixel aliasing, which has the affect of creating a saw-tooth pattern in the continuum (CUBISM User Manual).  PAHFIT was then run through both the SL and LL data cubes.  The SL data cube was fit separately from the LL data cube.

PAHFIT decomposes every spectrum in both the SL and LL data cubes.  In doing so, PAHFIT returns fit parameters to the specified features in the spectrum.  These parameters include extinction corrected integrated line flux, line FWHM, line equivalent width, and uncertainty.  The integrated flux measurements are extinction corrected within PAHFIT (see Smith et al. 2007 for the extinction curve).   While running PAHFIT through the data cubes, information concerning the position of each spectrum was retained.  This allows for the reconstruction of spectral feature (PAH, $\mathrm{H_2}$, ionization line) maps from the results of PAHFIT.  When using PAHFIT on an entire data cube, maps of every feature specified by PAHFIT were returned.  Additionally, the fit to each spectrum was retained and the fit to the continuum was reconstructed from internal PAHFIT functions.  From these two data cubes, a residual data cube and a continuum subtracted data cube were created for both the SL and LL data cubes.  These data cubes are crucial in determining the consistency of the fitted spectra.  In order to check the accuracy of the map of $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) integrated flux, it was compared it to the image created from the continuum subtraction to the SL data cube. 

In using PAHFIT, the default values for the temperatures of the starlight and eight thermal dust continuum components were used to fit the continuum.  Additionally, the optical depth of the dust extinction at 9.7 $\micron$ and 18 $\micron$  were also fit.  This was especially important in recovering an accurate measurement of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) 9.6 $\micron$ line in the 9.7 $\micron$ silicate absorption trough.

\subsection{CO Map}

The BIMA (Berkely Illinois Maryland Array) CO (J=1-0) map was acquired as a part of the BIMA Survey of  Nearby Galaxies (SONG) (Regan et al. 2001; Helfer et al. 2003). The CO map was mosaicked from 26 fields.  The beam size is 5.8 x 5.1 $\mathrm{arcsec}$ (220 x 190 $\mathrm{pc}$), the velocity channel width is 10 km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and the root-mean-square (rms) noise level is 61 mJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$.   

\subsection{X-ray Emission}

The map of x-ray emission from M51 was observed by the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on the $Chandra$ $X-Ray$ $Observatory$ on 20 June 2000.  The total integration time was 14,865 seconds.  Further details of the observations are presented in Terashima and Wilson (2001).

%\section{$\mathrm{H_2}$ Mapping Method}

%Spectral maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines were created with PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2006), a robust mid-infrared spectral fitting routine.

\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{$\mathrm{H_2}$ Emission Maps}

Molecular Hydrogen emission has been detected across \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines have been mapped across the radial  strip.  In figures 1 and 2, maps of the extinction corrected flux of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines are presented.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) lines (figure 1) lie in the LL module of the IRS and the resolution of the maps is 5.08 arcsec.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines (figure 2) lie in the SL module of the IRS and these maps each have a resolution of 1.85 arcsec.  This explains the relative smoothness of $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) maps compared to the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) maps.  
%For the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(5) lines, the IRS is sensitive to ...... for each line respectively.  
The boxes around the maps represent the regions over which the lines were mapped.  

%add line sensitivities

Maps reveal remarkable differences in the morphology of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) emission is strongest in the NW spiral arm with much lower levels of emission coming from the nucleus.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission peaks in the nucleus of the galaxy with strong emission in the NW and SE spiral arms.  In the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission, we are able to resolve molecular hydrogen emission in the outer spiral arms at several kiloparsecs from the center of the galaxy.  While we have resolved molecular hydrogen emission in the outer spiral arms, the peaks in $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission within the arms do not align.

The higher resolution $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) maps also show different morphology to \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) map shows the strongest emission in the nuclear region of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) line exhibits similar strong emission in the nuclear region; however, there appears to be a bar structure across the nucleus of the galaxy going north-to-south.  Again, we see offsets in the peak emission within the spiral arms of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  These offsets are real and indicate variations in the excitation-temperature in each region.

Maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines show a remarkably different morphology to the nuclear region of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) nuclear emission follows the nuclear emission of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) line, while the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) nuclear emission mirrors the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) emission.  This indicates variations in the excitation-temperature (further explored in section \S3.3).

Due to the sensitivity of the IRS low resolution module, we were unable to resolve $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) emission beyond the central region of \objectname{NGC 5194}.   For the same reason, we were unable to create maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(6) (at 6.11 \micron) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(7) (at 5.51 \micron) lines.  Deeper observations could reveal more complete maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) emission in \objectname{NGC 5194} in addition to allowing us to map the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(6) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(7) lines across \objectname{NGC 5194}.

\subsection{Mapping $\mathrm{H_2}$ Excitation-Temperature and Mass}

The pure rotational lines of molecular hydrogen provide a powerful probe of the conditions of the ISM and place constraints on the energy injection processes that excite $\mathrm{H_2}$.  Knowledge of the extinction corrected flux of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines allow for the mapping of the excitation-temperature and number density (and consequently mass).  The excitation-temperature and mass can be modeled across the galaxy by creating excitation diagrams at every position across the strip of NGC 5194.  

Excitation diagrams across NGC 5194 were created from the maps of $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission.  Each map was smoothed and interpolated to the resolution of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) line.  The non-rectangular shape to the excitation-temperature and mass are due to the offset in alignment between the LL and SL strips.  Excitation diagrams across the strip were derived from the Boltzman equation in similar form to the Rigopoulou et al. (2002).
\begin{equation}
N_i/N = (g(i)/Z(\mathrm{T_{ex}}))exp(-T_i/\mathrm{T_{ex}})
\end{equation}
where $g(i)$ is the statistical weight of state $i$, Z($\mathrm{T_{ex}}$) is the partition function, $\mathrm{T_i}$ is the energy level of a given state, and $\mathrm{T_{ex}}$ is the excitation temperature.  N and $\mathrm{N_i}$ are the total column density and the column density of a given state $i$ and is determined directly from the measured extinction corrected flux by
\begin{equation}
N_i = flux(i)/(A(i)h\nu (i))
\end{equation}
where A($i$) and $\nu$($i$) are the A-coefficient and frequency of state $i$ and $h$ is Planck's constant.  Table 1 lists the values for the wavelength ($\lambda$($i$)), rotational state (J), A($i$), $\mathrm{T_i}$, and $g(i)$ of the pure rotational levels of $\mathrm{H_2}$ that lie in the wavelength range covered by the IRS low resolution modules. 

The excitation diagrams exhibit an ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) in the nuclear region 3 (in agreement with the value of the OPR of the nuclear region determined by SINGS (Roussel et al. 2007, in press); this is determined from the fit to the best two-component fit to the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(5) lines.  Outside of the nuclear region, poor detection of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(4) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(5) lines prevents the mapping of OPR across the disk; however, the lower J lines exhibit an OPR of 3 within the spiral arms.

In the nuclear region of \objectname{NGC 5194}, the excitation diagram is smooth and its slope decreases at higher rotational levels (Figure 3).  This indicates that there is a range of temperatures being sampled within the beam.  Similar behavior has been observed in extragalactic targets by surveys of Seyferts (Rigopoulou et al. 2002) and ULIRGS (Higdon et al. 2006).  The temperature of the “warm” (T = 100 - 300 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ and the temperature of the “hot” (T = 400 - 1200 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ can be determined from the excitation diagrams by fitting the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) lines and the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2) - $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines respectively (as opposed to fitting all of the observed $\mathrm{H_2}$ rotational lines in order to derive a temperature of the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$).  
%Outside of the central region of \objectname{NGC 5194}, we notice a ``zigzag'' pattern emerge in the tail of the excitation diagram.  This behavior has been observed before in molecular outflow sources (Neufeld et al. 1999, Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2000, Neufeld et al. 2006).  The ``zigzag'' indicates a non-LTE OPR in these regions.  The degree of ``zigzag'' translates into the OPR, with less "zigzag" meaning an OPR closer to the LTE value of 3.  This also suggests that the OPR varies as a function of region across \objectname{NGC 5194}.

From a two-component fit to the excitation diagram, the excitation-temperature of the ``warm'' and ``hot'' components of $\mathrm{H_2}$, the ``warm'' and ``hot'' $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass have been mapped across \objectname{NGC 5194} (figures 4, 5, and 6).  In measuring the mass in $\mathrm{H_2}$, we determine the mass from the number density by multiplying the column density by the physical area within the beam (Rigopoulou et al. 2002).  At 9.6 Mpc (Sandage and Tammann 1975), 5.08 arcsec corresponds to 236.43 parsecs.  The maps of the mass distribution are in units of solar masses within a 55.899 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$ region.  

%is that right?

Figure 4 compares the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass to the temperature distribution of the mass.  The gas is warmest in the central region of \objectname{NGC 5194} with the temperature ranging from 225K - 275 K in the center of the galaxy.  The gas is coolest within the spiral arms of \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The outer NW and SE spiral arms (at about 6-7 kpc from the center of the galaxy each) contain on the order of 10,000 $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ (within a 55.9 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$ region) and 6,000 $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ (within a 55.9 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$ region) of $\mathrm{H_2}$ (in the NW and SE arms, respectively) and the gas within the outer spiral arms ranges from 150 K at the center of the arms to about 225 K near the edges.  Within the central oooo $\mathrm{pc^2}$ of the galaxy, there is oooo $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ of warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ and oooooo $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ hot $\mathrm{H_2}$.  These values are consistent with the masses of $\mathrm{H_2}$ found in the central regions of Seyferts (Rigopoulou et al. 2002).  In NGC 5194, the IRS is sensitive to 375 $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ and 5 $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ within the beam (though the sensitivity to the hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ could be underestimated due to smoothing the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) lines by a factor of ~ 3 times their resolution).

%enter values there

 Note that due to zero detection of $\mathrm{H_2}$ in some of the inner arm regions, we are unable to determine the temperature distribution across the entire strip.  This is evident towards the NW and SE edges of the radial strip.

The temperature and mass distribution of the hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ reveals a different picture (Figure 5).  There is significantly less mass in the hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ phase, on the order several hundred $\mathrm{M_\sun}$, depending on the region. The greatest amount of hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ is found within the nuclear region of \objectname{NGC 5194}; this is much different from the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ that dominates the spiral arms.  The hot gas exhibits cooler temperatures within the central regions of \objectname{NGC 5194} and the spiral arms.  Temperatures are greater in the inter-arm regions where there is less $\mathrm{H_2}$.  

%Figure 6 shows the $\mathrm{H_2}$ OPR across \objectname{NGC 5194}.  The OPR within the central regions of \objectname{NGC 5194} is generally close to the LTE value of 3. Across the galaxy, the OPR is lowest in the inter-arm regions falling to as low as 1.25.  The OPR varies across spiral arms, increasing towards the center of the arms.  In the following section, we explore the physical meaning of the OPR across varying regions of \objectname{NGC 5194}.

Due to the weakness of the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(2), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(3), $\mathrm{H_2}$S(4), and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) features beyond the spiral arms, the hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation temperature and mass can not be mapped over the whole strip.  While the radial strip across \objectname{NGC 5194} is helpful is understanding the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature and mass across the disk of the galaxy, complete IRS low resolution coverage of \objectname{NGC 5194} with longer integration time is necessary in order to understand hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ distribution and the $\mathrm{H_2}$ OPR across the whole galaxy.

\section{Discussion}

%\subsection{Radial Variations in the Warm and Hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ Excitation-Temperature and Mass}

\subsection{Distinguishing the $\mathrm{H_2}$ Excitation Mechanisms}

Previous studies of pure rotational H2 emission in galaxies have used aperture average spectra over the central regions of galaxies to understand the distribution of the warm and hot molecular gas phases within a galaxy (Rigopoulou et al. 2002, Higdon et al. 2006, Roussel et al. 2007, in press).  These studies use the pure rotational lines to derive excitation-temperatures and warm and hot H2 masses of the H2 within the galaxy.  Additionally, these studies compare the warm and hot H2 mass to the cold H2 mass traced by CO emission to in order to understand the mass fractions of the cold (T = 5 - 10 K), warm, and hot H2 mass.  These studies have had difficulty distinguishing the H2 excitation mechanisms within the galaxies

H2 is generally excited via three processes: 1.) excitation in photodissociation regions (PDRs) , 2.) shocks, and 3. )x-ray dissociation (XDRs).  Mapping the warm and hot H2 mass-excitation temperature and mass distributions provide the information necessary to understand whether the warm and hot H2 phases undergo excitation via the same mechanism.  This information coupled with spatially resolved diagnostics of PDRs, shocks, and XDRs put constraints on the dominant H2 excitation mechanism in NGC 5194, in different regions within NGC 5194. 

Figure (??) compares the warm H2 excitation temperature distribution to the mass distribution.  The excitation temperature is greatest within the nuclear region of the galaxy and is cooler in the spiral arms.  Within the nuclear region, the excitation temperature decreases moving radially away from the center of the galaxy.  Moving into the inner spiral arms, the excitation temperature decreases.  The excitation temperature within the inter-arm regions is greater than in the spiral arms.  

The excitation-temperature for the hot H2 phase peaks in the inter-arm regions (figure ??); the hot H2 mass peaks in the nuclear region of the galaxy.  This is contrasted to the warm H2 mass that peaks in the SW spiral arm.  Directly comparing the warm H2 mass to the hot H2 mass, shows that the ratio of warm-to-hot H2 is greater in spiral arms than in the nuclear region of the galaxy (figure ??).  In the nuclear region of the galaxy, the ratio of warm-to-hot H2 is 100.  Moving into the NW inner spiral arm and SE inner spiral arm, the ratio increase by a factor of 8 and 6.5 respectively.

The variations of the warm-to-hot mass ratio across the strip over NGC 5194 indicates that the primary excitation mechanisms of the warm and hot H2 differ. The warm H2 mass peaks in the NW inner spiral arm whereas the hot H2 mass peaks in the center.  This suggests that the warm H2 is associated with giant molecular clouds within spiral arms and is primarily excited by PDRs.  NGC 5194 is known to host a weak AGN in its nucleus (citation).  The hot H2 mass peaks in the nuclear region.  This could mean that the warm phase is primarily excited by the AGN.
 
In order to understand the excitation mechanisms of the warm H2 and the hot H2 and where each is dominant, we present comparisons of the H2 mass distributions to diagnostics of the three excitation mechanisms (PDRs, shocks, and XDRs).  CO rotational transitions are used as diagnostic lines of PDRs (Allen et al., 2004).  Comparing the H2 mass distributions to CO (J = 1 - 0) thus compares the location of the H2 mass to locations of giant molecular clouds.  The [OIV](25.98 \micron) emission arises fro shocks (Schaerer and Stasinska 1999).  Spatial mapping of [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission thus serves to discern regions where H2 is excited primarily by shocks.  H2 excitation by x-rays can also be discerned within M51a by comparing the H2 mass phases and emission to x-ray emission observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory (Terashima and Wilson 2001).  The following sections compare the H2 mass distributions to CO (J = 1 - 0) emission, [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission, and x-ray emission.

\subsection{H2 Excitation by PDRs: Comparison of H2 to CO emission}

While massive amounts of molecular gas have been observed at higher resolution within the nucleus of NGC 5194 (Scoville et al. 1998); the majority of the warm H2 is found in the spiral arms indicating the photodissociation by UV photons from giant molecular clouds is the primary mechanism for exciting the warm H2 phase.

\subsection{H2 Excitation by Shocks: Comparison of H2 to [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission}

The [OIV](25.89 \micron) line can be excited in shocks, the stellar winds of massive Wolf-Rayet stars, or by a active galactic nucleus (AGN)(Schaerer and Stasinska 1999, Lutz et al. 1998, Smtih et al. 2004).  Though the [OIV](25.89 \micron) line is bleneded with the [FeII](25.99 \micron) line in Spitzer IRS low resolution spectra; however, PAHFIT can deblend the two lines.  Thus, in mapping the H2 S(0) and H2 S(1) line in the LL data cubes, [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission is also be mapped. Figure (??) compares the [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission to the hot H2 disribution.  The [OIV] emission is brightest in the central region of the galaxy and its peak is cospatial with the peak in the mass of the hot H2.  Moving from the nucleus to the inner spiral arm, the [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission subsides.  Note also weak [OIV] emission within the spiral hot H2 spiral arms and in the inter-arm region (toward the SE spiral arm).

The [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission within the nuclear region is likely due to the weak Seyfert 2 nucleus (Ford et al. 1985) and could possibly be associated with shocked gas from the outflows of the AGN.  The peak of the [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission coincides with the peak in hot H2 mass indicating that the hot H2 phase in the nuclear region of the galaxy is AGN or shock heated.  With about 1000 $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ of hot H2 in the central 0.5 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$, it is unlikely that the hot H2 is fueling the central AGN, but rather is excited by the AGN or shocks produced by it.  While the warm H2 mass does not peak in the nuclear region of the galaxy, there is still a factor of \geq 100 $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ of H2 in the inner .05 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$. In fact, strong nuclear [OIV](25.89 \micron) emission is not cospatial with the warm (T = 100 - 300 K) H2 distribution indicating that AGN heating or shocks are not the primary mechanism for exciting H2 in the nuclear region.  

Comparing the [OIV](25.89 $\micron$) emission to the warm (T = 100 - 300 K)  H2 reveals that the [OIV] (25.89 $\micron$) emission to the inner edge of the inner spiral arms.  The [OIV](25.89 $\micron$) emission decreases in strength across the spiral arm.

%Scoville et al. (1998) suggested that the 1 x 10^{7} $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ of cold H2 surrounding the nuclear AGN would be sufficient to fuel the AGN

\subsection{H2 Excitation by XDRs: Comparison of H2 to X-ray emission}

M51 has been extensively studied in x-rays by ASCA (Terashima et al. 1998), Newton XMM (Dewangen et al. 2005),and  the Chandra X-ray Observatory (Terashima and Wilson 2001). These observations of the M51a,b system have revealed more than 80 x-ray sources.  Candidates for these x-ray sources include neutron stars, black holes, supernova remnants (SN 1994I), and a low-luminosity AGN (Terashima et al. 2006, Immler et al. 2002, Terashima and Wilson 2001).  X-ray emission from the nuclear region of NGC 5194 has been studied by Terashima and Wilson (2001).  At ~ 1" resolution, they observe x-ray emission from the nucleus, an extranuclear cloud (XNC, to the south of the nucleus), and the northern loop.  A radio jet has been observed connecting the nucleus of NGC 5194 to the XNC in 6 cm imagery (Crane and van der Hulst 1992).  The jet emanates from the south of the elongated nucleus and is shock heating ISM.

Figure (?) compares the 0.5 - 10 keV x-ray band image to the warm and hot H2 mass distributions.  There is very little correlation between the 0.5 - 10 keV x-ray emission and the warm H2 mass distribution indicating that x-rays play very little role in heating the warm H2 mass.  X-ray emission does correlate with the hot H2 mass. The brightest 0.5 - 10 keV x-ray emission originates from the nucleus and the southern XNC.  The hot H2 mass peak is cospatial with the nucleus and the mass decreases into the XNC.  Additionally, the hot H2 mass decreases moving into the northern loop.  The correlation between x-ray emission from the nucleus of NGC 5194 and the peak in hot H2 mass suggests that x-rays play an important role in exciting the hot phase of H2; however, due to the disparity in resolution between the x-ray image and the H2 maps (1" resolution for x-rays 5".08 resolution for the warm and hot H2 mass) it is difficult to distinguish between shock excitation and x-ray excitation of H2 in the nuclear region of NGC 5194.  

In order to distinguish between shock excitation and x-ray excitation of H2 in the nuclear region of NGC 5194, we compare the x-ray emission to the maps of the higher J H2 emission maps.  These maps have a resolution of ~ 1".85.  The H2 S(3) and H2 S(5) emission both are strongest between the nucleus and XNC, at the location of the radio jet, with the emission decreasing moving south into the XNC.  The strength of the H2 S(3) and H2 S(5) lines also decreases across the nucleus and into the northern spiral arm; however, the gradient is less steep.  The map of H2 S(3) emission shows that the bar structure in H2 emission is aligned with the AGN, radio jet, XNC, and northern loop.  The peak in H2 S(2) emission is centered on the nucleus and radio jet with the emission decreasing by 60\% across the XNC.

The offset of the peak in H2 S(2), H2 S(3), and H2 S(5) emission to the south the nucleus at the location of the jet indicates that the lower $J$ H2 lines are being shock heated by the radio jet in NGC 5194.

%\subsection{Physical Meaning of the OPR across NGC 5194}

%The $\mathrm{H_2}$ OPR has been extensively studied within the Milky Way Galaxy.   Observational studies have primarily focused on star forming regions (Wright et al. 1996, Timmerman et al. 1996, Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2000) and molecular outflow sources (Neufeld et al. 1998, Neufeld et al. 2006).  Wright et al. (2006) observed the star-forming region Ceph-A West and found that the OPR was 3 and that the excitation diagrams illustrated that the $\mathrm{H_2}$ temperature consisted of a range of components rather than a single component.  Studies of molecular clouds towards the center of the Galaxy find an OPR of about 1 $\pm$ 0.4 for these two regions (Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. 2000).  It should be noted however, that the size of these molecular clouds is on the order of one to a few parsecs; much smaller than the area observed within our beam.  Theoretical studies of $\mathrm{H_2}$ OPR have attempted to determine the OPR of newly formed $\mathrm{H_2}$ (Takashi, 2001),  OPR of $\mathrm{H_2}$ due to shocks (Timmermann, 1998), and the OPR of $\mathrm{H_2}$ in photodissociation regions (Sternberg and Neufeld, 1999).  

%We find that across the central regions of \objectname{NGC 5194} that the OPR is generally 3, indicating that the $\mathrm{H_2}$ OPR is in LTE.  This measurement is further confirmed by the SINGS determination of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ OPR of 3 within 330 $\mathrm{arcsec^2}$ aperture around the center of \objectname{NGC 5194} (Roussel et al., in prep.).  This measurement is based on Spitzer IRS high resolution spectra of NGC 5194.  This is a very interesting result because in the nucleus of \objectname{NGC 1594} is a weak AGN and within the surrounding regions.  IRS low resolution spectra reveal [OIV] emission within the central region of \objectname{NGC 5194} which indicates shock excitation of the ISM.  Additionally, H$\alpha$ imagery reveals massive HII regions around the nucleus of the galaxy (Scoville et al. 1999).  With possible shock excitation and FUV excitation of $\mathrm{H_2}$ within this region, why do we observe a LTE value for the $\mathrm{H_2}$ OPR within the nuclear region of \objectname{NGC 5194}?

%This observation could be confirmation that the true OPR abundance ratio is 3.  We find that the vast majority of the molecular gas is found within the central few kiloparsecs of the galaxy and finding the majority of the gas exhibiting an OPR of 3 can be seen as confirmation of an OPR of 3 being the natural abundance ratio. Other issues are the distances and time scales.  Our beam size is about 25.8 $\mathrm{arcsec^2}$ (55.9 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$).  Averaging over such a large area, we are likely to find $\mathrm{H_2}$ in LTE.

%The time it takes for a spiral density wave to synchronize star formation within the spiral arm of a galaxy is 30 million years (Vogel et al. 1988).   The size of such disturbance is on the order of several hundred parsecs, roughly the size of our beam (25.8 arcsec^2 or 55.9 kpc^2).  

%In the spiral arms and the inter-arm regions, the OPR deviates from 3.  In the spiral arms, the OPR ranges from 2 to about 2.5 with the higher values occurring towards the center of the spiral arms.  This seems consistent with the range of 1.5 - 2.2 for the OPR of FUV pumping dominated PDRs calculated by Sternberg and Neufeld (1999).  This suggests that the dominant process contributing to the non-LTE OPR in the spiral arms is FUV radiation. 

%In the inter-arm regions, the OPR falls to between 1.25 and 2.  Additionally, the hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ temperature in the inter-arm regions is in excess of 800 K.  This hints at a prior epoch of shock heating of the inter-arm regions. 

%Note that the OPR is strongly dependent on the extinction correction.   In creating $\mathrm{H_2}$ line maps, the extinction correction is applied within PAHFIT and Smith et al. (2006) note that the extinction curve could be unphysical if the emitting material undergoes differential extinction.  

%\subsection{Comparison of $\mathrm{H_2}$ to CO}

%Carbon monoxide (CO) observations are a powerful probe of the conditions of the cold molecular gas in the ISM.  Observations of the CO (J = 1-0) allow for the determination of the mass of the cold (T = 5-100 K) molecular hydrogen (Young and Scoville 1991).   In this section we use a map of the CO (J = 1-0) emission of \objectname{NGC 5194} acquired as part of the BIMA Survey of Nearby Galaxies (SONG) to compare the cold hydrogen mass traced by the CO emission to the warm and hot hydrogen mass traced by the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0)-$\mathrm{H_2}$S(5) line emission.

%Figure 7 compares $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission to CO emission for the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0)-$\mathrm{H_2}$S(3) lines.  In the nuclear region, the peak CO emission is offset from the peak $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$S(1) emission.  In the NW spiral arm (where $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) emission is the strongest), the $\mathrm{H_2}$S(0) spiral arm appears offset from the CO spiral arm.  We believe that this offset is an instrumental effect and results from the 5.08 arcsec/pixel resolution of map.

%The determination of the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass invokes the use of a conversion factor to convert the CO intensity to the $\mathrm{H_2}$ column density.  Here we adopt the equation for cold molecular gas mass calculated by Sheth et al. (2005)
%\begin{equation}
%M(H_2) = 1.36*1.1*10^4D^2S_{CO} 
%\end{equation}
%where D is the distance to \objectname{NGC 5194} in Mpc, $\mathrm{S_{CO}}$ is the intensity in Jy km $\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and M($\mathrm{H_2}$) is in solar masses.  This is based on the CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor of 2.8 x 10${^{20}}$ $\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ (Bloemen et al. 1986).

%Figure 8 shows the comparison between the mass in warm molecular hydrogen to the mass in cold molecular hydrogen as traced by CO emission.  The greatest amounts of warm and cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ are found in the spiral arms.  In general, the cold gas and warm gas are found in the same regions, though it should be noted that the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ found in the SE spiral arm (where there is no CO emission) is real.

%Figure 9 compares the mass  of $\mathrm{H_2}$ that is in the hot phase to the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ traced by CO emission.  There amount of mass in cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ outnumbers the mass in hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ by a factor of 10${^{4}}$ in in regions where there is strong CO emission.  The hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ appears to be found more concentrated in the nuclear regions with several hundred  $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ of warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ in the in the central 1 kpc of the galaxy.  In the spiral arms, the hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ traces the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$, but there are very small amounts of hot $\mathrm{H_2}$, on the order of 10 - 20 $\mathrm{M_\sun}$ within a 55.9 $\mathrm{kpc^2}$ area.

\section{Conclusions}

We have mapped the pure rotational $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission over NGC 5194 using the Spitzer IRS low resolution modules.  We have used maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission to understand the spatial distribution of warm (T = 100 - 300 K) and hot (T = 400 - 1000 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ in NGC 5194.  We find:\\
\\
1.  The morphology of H2 emission in NGC 5194 varies with H2 rotational level.  H2 S(0) emission is strongest in the spiral arms of the galaxy while the lower J transitions show the strongest emission towards the nucleus.  The H2 S(0) and H2 S(1) maps (at 5.08 arcsec resolution) show emission across the entire strip out to spiral arms located several kpc from the center of the galaxy.  The H2 S(2) and H2 S(3) maps (at 1.85 arcsec resolution) reveal H2 in the nucleus, spiral arms, and inter-arm regions of NGC 5194. An interesting example is that H2 S(3) emission reveals bar structure across the center of the galaxy.  Strong H2 S(4) and H2 S(5) emission is resolved in the nuclear region of NGC 5194.\\
\\
2.  The different morphologies of  H2 emission in NGC 5194 indicate variations in H2 excitation-temperature, mass, and OPR. From maps of the emission of the lowest pure rotational transitions, the excitation-temperature and mass are mapped across the strip.  The excitation-temperatures of the warm and hot phases are higher in the nucleus and inter-arm regions of the galaxy and lower in the spiral arms. We find that the warm H2 and the hot H2 are not cospatial.  The hot mass peaks in the central region of NGC 5194 and the warm mass peaks in the NW spiral arm (in our strip coverage).  Ratio maps indicate the the warm-to-hot mass ratio varies in NGC 5194.  In the nucleus, the ratio is ~ 100 and it increases to ~ 800  in the NW spiral arm.  Variations in the warm-to-hot H2 ratio indicate that the primary excitation mechanism differs between warm and hot H2. 

%3.  We measure the OPR in the central region on NGC 5194 to be 3.  We do not measure the OPR across the galaxy due to poor resolution on the H2 S4 and H2 S5 lines outside the nucleus of NGC 5194.\\
\\
3. We compare the warm and hot H2 to the cold H2 traced by CO (J = 1 - 0) emission.  The largest amounts of cold and warm H2 are found in the spiral arms while the \\
\\
4.  The NGC 5194 is a Seyfert II galaxy that hosts a weak AGN in its nucleus.  We observe strong [OIV](25.89 $\micron$) emission from the central region of the galaxy. The [OIV](25.89 $\micron$) emission is cospatial with the hot H2 mass suggesting that the hot H2 is primarily excited by an AGN or by strong shocks (possibly associated with the central AGN).  It should be noted that x-ray excitation can not be excluded as an excitation mechanism for the hot H2.  Strong x-ray emission has been observed in from the central AGN in NGC 5194\\
