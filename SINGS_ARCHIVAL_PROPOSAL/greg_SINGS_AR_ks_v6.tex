\section{Scientific Justification}

\subsection{Mapping Molecular Hydrogen Excitation and Mass in Nearby Galaxies from the SINGS Archive}

The fundamental evolutionary process in a galaxy is the conversion of gas into stars.  In the Milky Way, all star formation occurs in molecular clouds (Blitz 1995); although, not all molecular clouds are actively forming stars.  In galaxies, star formation is triggered whenever the molecular gas surface density is enhanced, for example, by a spiral density wave (Vogel et al. 1988), by increased pressure as in galactic nuclei (Young and Devereux 1991),  due to the hydrodynamic shock along the leading edge of bars, and in the transition region at the ends of bars (Sheth et al. 2000, Kenney and Lord 1991).  Although the connection between star formation and molecular gas is well-established, the exact mechanisms for initiating, controlling, and inhibiting star formation are not well-known.\\

%These observations provide constraints on the energy injection processes (i.e. radiative heating, shocks, turbulence) that heat the molecular gas phases as a function of position in a galaxy.  Thus, molecular gas in fundamentally connected with the evolution of a galaxy.\\

%Thus, molecular gas serves as the fuel for star formation and is fundamentally connected with galaxy evolution.\\

% through a variety of processes.
Prior to the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer), much of our knowledge of the conditions of the molecular gas in galaxies came from studies of CO emission and rotational-vibrational transitions of $\mathrm{H_2}$ in the near-infrared.  CO rotational line emission directly traces the mass of the coldest (T = 5 -- 100 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ while the near-infrared  $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission traces the hot (T  $\geq$ 1000 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$.  This leaves the intermediate, warm (T = 100 -- 1000 K) molecular gas unexplored.  With Spitzer, the warm (T = 100 - 1000 K) molecular gas can be observed through the pure rotational transitions of $\mathrm{H_2}$ with lower $J$ $\mathrm{H_2}$ lines tracing the 100 - 300 K $\mathrm{H_2}$ and higher $J$ lines tracing the 300 - 1000 K $\mathrm{H_2}$.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(0) (28.2 $\mu$m) and $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(1) (17.0 $\mu$m) lines are observed with the Spitzer IRS long-low (LL) modules (14 - 38 $\mu$m, with LL2 covering 14 - 21 $\mu$m and LL1 covering 21 - 38 $\mu$m)(see Figure 1).  These lines trace the warm (T = 100 - 300 K) molecular gas.\\

The $Spitzer$ $Infrared$ $Nearby$ $Galaxies$ $Survey$ (SINGS) legacy program has surveyed 75 nearby galaxies (Kennicutt et al. 2003).  These galaxies range in Hubble type, luminosity, star formation, and nuclear activity.  The SINGS legacy has used the Spitzer IRS LL (LL1 and LL2)  module in spectral mapping mode to map radial strips across 65 galaxies within their sample.  The radial strips cover a range of dynamically distinct regions within galaxies (i.e. nuclei, spiral arms, HII regions, etc.).  The strips are roughly 50 x 600 arcsec in area and give us spatially resolved spectra (at a resolution of $\sim$ 5 arcsec) across the galaxies (Figure 2).   {\bf These strips contain a wealth of data on the spatial distribution of molecular hydrogen yet to be studied.}\\

%In addition to observing $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) in the LL strips, there are a atomic features ([NeIII] (15.55 $\mu$m), [SIII](18.71 $\mu$m), [FeII](25.98 $\mu$m), [OIV](25.89 $\mu$m), [SIII](33.48 $\mu$m), and [SiII](34.82 $\mu$m) and broad PAH complexes  at 16.4 $\mu$m and 17.0 $\mu$m (Smith et al. 2004).\\

%While the SINGS team is currently studying the $\mathrm{H_2}$ lines (Roussel et al. 2007, in preparation), {\bf they have only done so for the nuclear regions} of the SINGS sample.  Their study of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ uses aperture averaged spectra over the nuclei  of the 65 galaxies to determine the excitation-temperature, mass, and ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) of $\mathrm{H_2}$ within the galaxies.  Their study {\bf does not} explore $\mathrm{H_2}$ outside of the nuclei of the galaxies and they {\bf do not} take advantage of the spatial resolution of the spectra across the galaxy.\\

{\bf We propose to take advantage of the spectacular SINGS IRS LL coverage across both the nuclear regions and disks in order to understand the spatial distribution of the warm (T = 100 - 300 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ across a sample of 18 galaxies that have been observed by both SINGS and the  Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Array Survey of Nearby Galaxies (BIMA SONG) (Regan et al. 2001, Helfer et al. 2003)}.  The 18 galaxies (listed in Table 1) have been studied as part of BIMA SONG  for which we have CO (J = 1 - 0) maps for each galaxy.  CO (J = 1 - 0) emission traces the cold (T = 5 - 10 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ and the maps allow us to understand the spatial distribution of the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass.  We will use the SINGS LL data cubes to map the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) lines across the galaxies.  From these lines we will model the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass, excitation-temperature, and UV radiation field across the galaxies (Kaufman et al. 2006).  We will correlate the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ (traced by CO emission) with the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ (traced by the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) emission) in order to understand the relationship between the warm and cold $\mathrm{H_2}$. 
%We will correlate the cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ (traced by CO emission), warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ (traced by the $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$(0-0)S(1) emission), and hot (traced by $\mathrm{H_2}$(2-1)S(1)(2.248 $\mu$m) and $\mathrm{H_2}$(1-0)S(1)(2.121 $\mu$m) emission  in order to understand the relationship between different $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass phases.  
Additionally, we would like to understand the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation mechanisms by comparing the $\mathrm{H_2}$ distribution to UV and optical imagery (U, B, V, R, and $\mathrm{H_\alpha}$) and the mid-infrared spectral diagnostics ([O IV](25.89 $\mu$m), a shock diagnostic and the [S III](33.48 $\mu$m)/[S III](18.71 $\mu$m) ratio, an HII region electron density diagnostic). The latter two are also mapped by the SINGS LL data cubes.\\

%and have CO (J = 1 - 0) maps publicly available on the NASA extragalactic database (NED).  

For a pilot study, we used IRS spectral mapping data for M51a (the Whirlpool galaxy, NGC 5194), acquired in Cycle 2 (GO - 20138, PI: Sheth, K.).  Building upon CUBISM and PAHFIT (Smith et al. 2007), we have developed a new and unique software code to create extinction-corrected and continuum-subtracted line maps.  This capability {\bf is not} available via CUBISM or PAHFIT but is the logical next improvement as it creates a full two-dimensional map of any desired feature. 
Our software processes IRS low resolution data cubes created in CUBISM, then uses PAHFIT as the engine to simultaneously decompose the spectrum at each point in the map and reconstructs the best fit fluxes for every feature into individual two-dimensional  maps.  These maps are analogous to a continuum-subtracted $\mathrm{H_\alpha}$ map or a CO map which most observers are used to, except that we can produce maps for every mid-infrared diagnostic available to Spitzer.  This technique is particularly powerful for blended features such as $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) (blended with the PAH feature at 17.0 $\mu$m) which cannot be extracted from available software packages.\\ 

Maps of $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) emission across M51a are shown in Figure 3.  These maps were produced with our software.  We used these lines to model the excitation-temperature and mass distribution of the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ across the disk of M51a.  In Figure 4, we show the distribution of the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass compared to the excitation-temperature.  We find that the $\mathrm{H_2}$ is warmest within the center of the galaxy and is coolest in the spiral arms (which contain the bulk of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass).  Comparison of the CO map (the cold  $\mathrm{H_2}$) to the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ shows offsets in the location of the peak emission within the spiral arms.  Why is this?  Do we see this in other galaxies?  Comparisons to UV imagery, optical imagery, and mid-infrared spectral feature maps can help us to answer these questions.\\

%Additionally, we are able to map $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature and mass in spiral arms out to 7 kpc from the nucleus of the galaxy.  The SINGS LL strips cover greater distances allowing us to understand how excitation-temperature and $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass vary as a function of galactocentric radius for 18 galaxies.\\

%We have also modeled the ortho-to-para ratio (OPR) across M51a.  From our study we found that the lower pure rotational levels ($\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1), $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(2), and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(3)) exhibit an OPR of 3 (or very close to) in the nuclear and spiral arm regions.  Under the assumption that the OPR is 3 across the galaxies, we can map the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature and $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass across the 18 galaxies that we would like to study.\\

For the 18 galaxies observed by both SINGS and SONG we will address the following:\\

{\bf 1. How does the warm (T = 100 - 300 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature and mass vary across dynamically distinct regions within galaxies?}  The majority of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass radiates in the lower energy level $\mathrm{H_2}$ lines.  In mapping the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) lines across the LL strips we can model the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature and mass distributions across the galaxies (Rigopoulou et al. 2002, Higdon et al. 2006). In addition to modeling the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation and mass across the galaxies, we will use $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) line ratios to model the radiation field across the galaxies (Kaufman et al. 2006).  This will allow us to undertand how the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation and mass vary between the nucleus, spiral arms, inter-arm regions, and dust lanes within the galaxies. These observations provide constraints on the energy injection processes (i.e. radiative heating, shocks, turbulence) that heat the molecular phases as a function of position in a galaxy.\\

{\bf 2.  How do the cold and warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ correlate across dynamically distinct regions in galaxies?  Are there offsets in the location of the warm and cold $\mathrm{H_2}$?  If so, why?}  CO (J = 1 - 0) emission traces the cold (T = 5 - 10 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$.  The combination of CO data and the $\mathrm{H_2}$ lines for every galaxy will allow us to correlate the different molecular gas phases.  Is the warm molecular gas strongly associated with the surface layers of giant molecular clouds as predicted by Kaufman et al. (2006) or an inter-arm component that is bright in $\mathrm{H_2}$ but devoid of CO?  We find that in M51a, the warm and cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ are offset in different regions.  Do we observe offsets in the location of warm and cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ in other galaxies?  Offsets in the location of the cold and warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ are most likely due to the heating sources (such as massive star formation) which we can examine from U, B, V, R, and $\mathrm{H_{\alpha}}$ data.  The U, B, V, R and $\mathrm{H_{\alpha}}$ imagery provide a means to identify actively star forming regions within spiral galaxies and determine the age, metallicity, and star formation rate of stellar clusters and associations in actively star forming galaxies (Talbot et al. 1979, Jensen et al. 1981, Calzetti et al. 2005).\\

%{\bf 3. How do the warm and hot $\mathrm{H_2}$ phases correlate across each galaxy?}  Near infrared ro-vibrational line emission has been observed in starbursts and Seyferts (Joseph et al. 1984, Moorwood and Oliva 1988).  Narrow band $\mathrm{H_2}$ line imaging has been used to study starbursts NC 520, NGC 1614, and NGC 7714 (Kotilainen et al. 2001).  We are applying for time on various telescopes  (OAM/UNAM, etc.) with narrow band near infrared $\mathrm{H_2}$ filters to observe the $\mathrm{H_2}$(2-1)S(1)(2.248 $\mu$m) and $\mathrm{H_2}$(1-0)S(1)(2.121 $\mu$m) emission across our sample (and NGC 5194).  This combination of spatially resolved $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission across each galaxy will allow us to understand the temperature and excitation sources of the different molecular hydrogen phases in galaxies.\\

%We will compare optical and UV emission to $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass in order to understand the origin of offsets in the location of cold and warm $\mathrm{H_2}$.\\

%Offsets in the location of the cold and warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ are most likely due to the potential heating sources (such as massive star formation or embedded star formation) which we can readily examine from $\mathrm{H_{\alpha}}$ emission and MIPS 24 $\mu$m emission (maps of both are readily available ancillary data).\\ 

{\bf 3.  How do the warm and cold $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass correlate with other mid-infrared spectral diagnostics?}  The [O IV](25.89 $\mu$m) line has been observed to arise from shocks, the stellar winds of Wolf-Rayet stars, high-mass star photoionization, and active galactic nuclei (Schaerer and Stasinska 1999, Lutz et al. 1998, Smith et al. 2004).  With our software, we are able to de-blend the [Fe II](25.98 $\mu$m) and [O IV](25.89 $\mu$m) lines.  This allows us to discern regions where shocks are exciting the ISM.  If we observe [O IV](25.89 $\mu$m) emission coinciding with $\mathrm{H_2}$, this would imply that the $\mathrm{H_2}$ is excited by shocks.  Additionally, the ratio of the [S III](33.48 $\mu$m) and [S III](18.71 $\mu$m) lines provide a determination of the electron density in HII regions.  Comparison to the $\mathrm{H_2}$ data will allow us to determing the location of cold and warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ relative to the hot ionized gas (and thus the sites of current star formation) in HII regions.  

%This will allow us to understand the relationship of the hot ionized gas and and the warm and cold molecular gas within the spiral arms of galaxies.  We will use our ability to spatially resolve the mid-infrared emission features to discern the excitation mechanism of warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ in dynamically different regions of the galaxies.\\

\subsection{Utilizing and Extending the SINGS Legacy}

The SINGS legacy archive has delivered maps of bright infrared emission features from the LL radial strips as part of their data products.  They have created emission line maps using CUBISM but are only able to produce maps of un-blended emission features that are bright across the entire galaxy.  They are delivering  [Ne III](15.5 $\mu$m) and [Si II](34.8 $\mu$m) line maps (Kennicutt et al. 2003).  {\bf Our software will produce maps of every emission feature in the LL data cubes, even the extremely faint (such as $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0)) or blended lines (such as [O IV](25.89 $\mu$m) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1)) (see Figure 3).}  Much of the analysis discussed here constitutes the proposed thesis work of G. Brunner; however, the wealth of data and maps produced will not be fully analyzed in the time frame for his thesis. We believe that these maps will be of use to the larger community and we will release all of the maps and the software to the public following the submission of our analysis for publication.\\ 

To date, the SINGS legacy has not studied the spatially resolved spectra across the SL or LL data cubes.  Their studies of atomic features (Dale et al. 2006), PAHs (Smith et al. 2007), and $\mathrm{H_2}$ (Roussel et al., in press) use aperture-averaged spectra over the nuclear regions (and extranuclear HII regions in the case of Dale et al. 2006). Our software, maps, and analysis of the spatially resolved $\mathrm{H_2}$ will be an ideal complement to the SINGS legacy.

%\subsection{Utilizing the SINGS Legacy}

%Our study extends the SINGS mission and augments an already strong legacy program.  The SINGS legacy has delivered maps of bright infrared emission features from the LL radial strips as part of their data products.  They create emission line maps within the CUBISM software and are only able to produce maps of emission features that are very bright across the entire galaxy.  The line maps that they have delivered are of [NeIII](15.5 $\mu$m) and [SiII](34.8 $\mu$m) line emission (Kennicutt et al. 2003).  {\bf Our software produces maps of every emission feature in the LL data cubes, even the extremely faint (such as $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0)) or blended lines (such as [OIV](25.89 $\mu$m) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1)) (see figure 3).}\\ 

%To date, the SINGS legacy {\bf has not} studied the spatially resolved spectra across the SL or LL data cubes.  Their studies of atomic features (Dale et al. 2006), PAHs (Smith et al. 2007), and $\mathrm{H_2}$ (Roussel et al., in press) have used aperture averaged spectra over the nuclear regions (and extranuclear HII regions in the case of Dale et al. 2006) of their galaxies. Our software, maps, and analysis of the spatially resolved $\mathrm{H_2}$ are unique and will supplement the SINGS legacy.

%The comparison of $\mathrm{H_2}$ emission to other mid-infrared spectral diagnostics will allow us to understand the conditions of the ISM across galaxies and the processes that excite the ISM.  In figure 3, we present maps of $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1), [OIV](25.89 $\mu$m), [SIII](33.48 $\mu$m), and [SIII](18.71 $\mu$m) from M51a.\\

\section{Technical Plan}

%{\bf Data Reduction:} We will construct data cubes from the IRS observations using CUBISM (citation).  Both the PI (Brunner) and Co-I (Sheth) are experts with the CUBISM software.  The PI will be responsible for producing data cubes of the galaxies.  CO maps from the BIMA survey are already reduced and they are science ready.\\

The SINGS legacy has provided IRS low resolution data cubes for 65 galaxies.  As of data release 4 (DR4), there are 16 galaxies observed by SONG that have publicly available SINGS low resolution data cubes.  Two more SONG galaxies will have data cubes available via data release 5 (DR5).  The 18 galaxies that we will study are listed in Table 1.\\

Data cubes for individual SINGS galaxies are publically available.  They can be found at:\\
 http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/SINGS/galaxies/.\\  
 
We will also construct CUBISM cube projects (not publicly available) for each of the 18 galaxies that we will be studying. CUBISM is the data reduction software for IRS spectral cubes.  Both Brunner and Sheth are experts with the CUBISM software.\\

{\bf Data Analysis:}  $\mathrm{H_2}$ maps, atomic line maps, and PAH feature maps will be created using the software developed by the PI and Co-Is while working on M51a.  Our software has the ability to create maps of spectral features that are extremely faint and/or are blended with other spectral features.  This allows the recovery of faint $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) emission and the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) line (blended with the  PAH 17.0 $\mu$m complex).  Our software takes both SL and LL data cubes in FITS format, processes them, and then runs PAHFIT through the cubes (Smith et al. 2007).  PAHFIT is a mid-infrared spectral fitting routine that decomposes spectra into individual components and measures the integrated line flux of features. In running our software through a data cube, we save the flux measurement for every line from 14 - 38 $\mu$m at every spatial position, and in doing so, we create maps of every feature observed in the LL data cubes.  This is a very powerful tool for understanding the spatial variation of mid-infrared spectral features, especially the $\mathrm{H_2}$ lines.  Figure 3 displays maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0), $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1), [O IV](25.89 $\mu$m), [S III](18.71 $\mu$m), and [S III](33.48 $\mu$m) emission across a strip of M51a that has been spectrally mapped with the Spitzer IRS LL modules.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) line and the [O IV](25.89 $\mu$m) lines are blended with spectral features (the 17.0 $\mu$m PAH complex and [Fe II](25.98 $\mu$m), respectively) but our software is able to map the emission across the entire IRS LL strip.\\

We will use maps of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) emission to model the warm (T = 100 - 300 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation-temperature and mass across the SINGS LL strips.  The $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) lines place constraints on the $\mathrm{H_2}$ excitation and mass within a galaxy.  Additionally, ratios of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(0) and $\mathrm{H_2}$ S(1) lines probe the radiation field of dense PDRs and molecular clouds in star forming regions.  Brunner and Wolfire will lead the $\mathrm{H_2}$ modeling effort.\\

We will compare the warm $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass distribution to the cold (T = 5 - 10 K) $\mathrm{H_2}$ mass distribution traced by CO emission.  We will use the MIRIAD package to analyze the CO data and we will use WIP to compare the spatial distribution of $\mathrm{H_2}$, CO, and the mid-infrared spectral diagnostics. Brunner will lead the data analysis though it should be mentioned that Brunner, Sheth, Wolfire, and Vogel all have extensive experience with MIRIAD and WIP.  Sheth and Vogel were both integral members of the BIMA collaboration and have tremendous insight into the CO data and results.  Interpretation of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ results and the comparisons of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ to CO will be shared by Brunner, Sheth, and Vogel.\\


%Brunner and Dufour will be responsible for the ground based observations of the near infrared $\mathrm{H_2}$ lines, $\mathrm{H_2}$(2-1)S(1)(2.248 $\mu$m) and $\mathrm{H_2}$(1-0)S(1)(2.121 $\mu$m).  Dufour has experience observing on at OAM/UNAM with CAMILA (which has narrow band $\mathrm{H_2}$ filters between 1 - 2.5 $\mu$m).  We are also considering proposing for time on larger telescopes with near infrared $\mathrm{H_2}$ filters, such as UKIRT.\\

Comparison of the $\mathrm{H_2}$ to the U, B, V, R, and $\mathrm{H_\alpha}$ imagery and mid-infrared spectral diagnostics will be shared by Brunner and Dufour.  Dufour is an expert on UV, optical, and IR imagery and spectroscopy and will provide insight into the meaning of the comparisons between the $\mathrm{H_2}$ and optical imagery, UV imagery, and IR diagnostic maps. \\

{\bf The data analysis described here is a massive undertaking and coupled with the analysis of $\mathrm{H_2}$ in M51a (from GO - 20057), it will provide the foundation for PI Brunner's Ph.D. thesis on the spatial distribution of $\mathrm{H_2}$ in nearby galaxies.}\\

\section{Cost Plan and Budget Narrative}

Below is the narrative for the Rice University Cost Plan (R. J. Dufour, administrative PI) for which the proposal PI, Greg Brunner, is a graduate student.  The total costs for the PI and Co-I at Rice for a 1 year period beginning 1 October 2007 is \$81,765.  Separately Dr. Kartik Sheth of the Spitzer Science Center is requesting \$15,000 support during this period though SSC.  Co-Is  Vogel and Wolfire of the University of Maryland are not requesting separate support.  Therefore, the total support requested for this archival project is \$96,765.\\

%K. Sheth, S.N. Vogel, and M. Wolfire request \$15,000 for travel, publications and computing support during this period though SSC.  Therefore, the total support requested for this archival project is \$96,765.\\

The primary direct cost items are salaries for G. Brunner and R. Dufour.  Since the scientific PI will be a third-year graduate student in October 2007, the stipend will be \$24,700 per year (assuming he will qualify for Ph. D. candidacy in September 2007).  Brunner just completed six months of residency at SSC as a Graduate Student Fellow working with Sheth et al. on $\mathrm{H_2}$ mapping of M51.  Currently this is being submitted for publication and also will be submitted and defended by Brunner for Ph.D. candidacy during the summer of 2007.  If this proposal is approved, then the described research will be a major part of Brunner's Ph.D. dissertation.  As noted in the proposal, Brunner will be analyzing 2D IRS observations and mapping of molecular hydrogen properties across 18 galaxies previously observed by SINGS, which is a massive amount of data reduction, including comparison with IR-visible imagery of the galaxies.  Realistically, such a large project will take longer than a year, but here we are limited to proposing for the first year of research (given some will have already been done by the time the funding is in place).  Currently Brunner is being supported by AURA/HST grants involving UV-optical imagery/spectroscopy of emission nebulae and can only work part time on the Spitzer $\mathrm{H_2}$ mapping.  However, this should be nearly completed in late 2007 so he will be able to pursue this proposed research full time when funding is in place.\\

R. Dufour is a Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Rice University and has been at Rice since 1976 studying star-forming galaxies and nebulae.  He will be Brunner's primary thesis advisor and administrative PI for this project.  He is requesting one month of summer salary support (\$10,395).  Dufour expects to become involved in the project scientifically as well as administratively at a level of approximately 3 weeks per semester (Rice permits up to 50\% of the academic time for research during the 9-month school year) and 1 month during the summer.\\

Other direct cost items include \$4,200 in travel for Brunner to take ~5-day trips to SSC to consult with Sheth, to the University of Maryland to consult with Vogel and Wolfire, and one domestic scientific meeting (e.g. AAS) to present the results of this research.  Additionally, \$4,200 is requested for publication costs (approximately two ~15 page ApJ or AJ articles) which is arguably conservative given the large amount of data and galaxies proposed to be studied.  Modest amounts is requested for research materials and supplies (\$600) and computer services (\$1200 -- IDL, user fees, and maintenance support).  No equipment is requested, all of the hardware (and software) necessary for the project is in place at Rice.\\

Therefore the direct costs are \$35,095 (salaries), \$4,200 (travel), and \$6,000 (publications, maintenance, and supplies) = \$57,332 total.  Fringe benefits on the salaries is \$12,307 and indirect costs are \$24,453.  Therefore, the total is \$81,785 for the Rice University share of the project cost.
